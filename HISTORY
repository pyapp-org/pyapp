4.15.1
======

Bugfix
------

- Fix for certain edge cases where loglevel is not supplied.


4.15
====

Features
--------

- Command decorators can now be supplied with an alternate loglevel to
  allow certain commands to use a different level.

Bugfix
------

- Fix initial log replay so the specified log-level is correctly applied.


4.14
====

Features
--------

- Add tooling for generating documentation of settings by inspecting the
  default_settings file.


Project Changes
---------------

- All linting and formatting is now handled by pre-commit using ruff.


4.13.1
======

Fixes
-----

- Update utils.inspect.import_root_module to handle ``__mp_main__`` module
  correctly.


4.13
====

Changes
-------

- Added ext_block_list to allow for blocking of extensions to CliApplication.

- Allow ext_allow_list and ext_block_list to include glob patterns.

Pending Deprecations
--------------------

- Deprecated the use of ``ext_white_list`` in favour of ``ext_allow_list``.


4.12
====

Changes
-------

- Introduction of typed_settings, providing a cleaner way to access default settings
  that supports auto-completion and type inference. And preparing the way for more
  in-depth checks that ensure settings values match the expected types.

- Support ``Literal`` types in CLI. Maps str and int literals to choices.

- Support sequences of Enum values in the CLI. This is implemented via the
  ``AppendEnumValue`` and ``AppendEnumName`` actions.

- Migrate from pkg_resources to the standardised builtin importlib.metadata.

- Fix for handling events/callbacks on classes where the parent has __slots__ defined.


4.11.0
======

Changes
-------

- Self is now ignored in command handlers if it is the first argument. This covers
  the case where a non ``staticfunction`` is used as a handler when grouped as part
  of a command group.

- Allow CLI entry points to define an argument as a date, time or datetime type
  which will accept an valid ISO8601 string.

- Add pre_dispatch, post_dispatch and dispatch_error events to CliApplication


4.10.1
======

Changes
-------

- Fix issue with docs build related to Poetry and RTD


4.10.0
======

Changes
-------

- Add implementation of ``multiprocessing.Pool`` that ensures that settings are
  mirrored into any worker process.

- Include pytest plugin to provide fixtures


4.9.0
=====

Changes
-------

- Changed settings to be support being pickled.

- Added feature to export and restore settings into a serialised form for
  use-cases where settings need to be duplicated (eg deploying tasks into a
  spark cluster where settings are required).


4.8.2
=====

Changes
-------

- Extend change to RegexType to allow for any custom ArgumentType by extending
  the ArgumentType ABC.

- Allow CLI entry points to define an argument as Sequence[Enum] and obtain a
  list of enum values.


4.8.1
=====

Changes
-------

- Fix bug with RegexType argument where regex searched input string not raising
  an invalid argument if the input _contained_ a valid string.

- Support RegexType in type annotations for command line generation.


4.8.0
=====

Changes
-------

- Dropping official support for Python 3.6 and 3.7

- Fix bug in NamedSingletonFactory and ThreadLocalNamedSingletonFactory classes
  that skipped the singleton wrapper causing a new instance to be generated each
  time.


4.7.2
=====

Changes
--------

- Fix feature_flags.if_enabled to ensure doc string and function name are passed
  to the decorator wrapper.


4.7.1
=====

Changes
-------

- Improve the settings reset to properly apply the base-settings after reset.
  These are the basic settings required for the application to operate
  correctly.


4.7.0
=====

Features
--------

- Add reset option to settings modify context to allow settings to be completely
  cleared during testing. This is particularly useful for testing CLI methods.


4.6.0
=====

Features
--------

- Builtin feature flags support for enabling functionality at runtime

Changes
-------

- Change to initial logger so early log commands are replayed to the entire
  logging framework after logging has been configured. This could cause initial
  log messages to be displayed subtly different however log messages will follow
  the rules defined in your logging configuration.


4.5.0
=====

Features
--------

- Add TOML support for remote configuration.


Security Updates
----------------

- By default require TLS 1.2 for HTTPS connections to fetch remote configuration.


4.4.0
=====

Features
--------

- Delayed logging on startup, initial log messages are stored (critical messages
  are still displayed) to allow for logging to be configured before the stored
  messages are replayed for the now active logger. This also opens up the option
  of file only based logging.

- Command signature can now accept the Optional values for both positional are
  optional arguments, this allows for optional positional arguments.

- Argument grouping support enable, with builtin CLI commands grouped.

- Single file scripts. A single script can now be used with pyApp, allowing even
  quick scripts to take advantage of pyApp features and extensions.

- Command signature generation. CLI arguments are generated from the arguments
  signature of the command function.

- Improvements to checks to handle unexpected exceptions. Rather than checks
  outright failing errors are caught and reported along with a stack trace.

- Switch to using poetry


Bug fixes
---------

- Custom logging configuration was not being applied for logging defined in settings

- Using an _ in a positional argument signature caused an exception in argparse

- Positional arguments caused an exception in argparse, a entire new suit of tests
  was added to address this issue.


4.3.0
=====

Features
--------

- Async commands, ``app.command`` can not be applied to async functions and
  handle the event loop.

- ``app.default`` now returns a Command Proxy supporting async and additional
  command line arguments.


4.2.0
=====

Features
--------

- Added Object config loader, to aid in integration into other frameworks eg
  Django.

- Add argument action for handling Enums

- Add argument type for validation with regex


Fixes
-----

- Utilisation of pylint to improve and maintain code quality.

- Use `sys.exit` instead of the `exit`.

- Fix command aliases not being resolved at run-time bug.


Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

- The ``inject_into`` decorator has been removed use the simpler ``inject``
  decorator in it's place.


4.1.0
=====

Features
--------

- Coloured log output be default (for ttys)
- Root module no longer required for CliApplication, is auto resolved (most of
  the time)
- Added compatibility tools for marking methods to be deprecated.

Fixes
-----

- Change ``exit`` to ``sys.exit`` for compatibility with `pyinstaller`_.
- Greatly improved documentation, some sections re-written to improve clarity.
- Correct when event bindings are stored.

.. _pyinstaller: https://www.pyinstaller.org/

  will be removed in 4.2.0.


4.0.6

Features
--------

- Aliases for NamedPluginFactory entries

Changes
-------

- Generate explicit CannotImport exception if an invalid object is specified to
  a NamedFactory.
- Have checks handle import errors


4.0.4
=====

Features
--------

- Added callbacks in addition to events
- Added specific exceptions for NamedFactories
- Added NoDefault mode
- Updated extension report to report code (so extensions that register multiple
  items don't just look like duplicates)
- Shorted name of inject_into to inject (left alias of inject_into)
- Shorted name of FactoryArgs to Args (left alias of FactoryArgs)
