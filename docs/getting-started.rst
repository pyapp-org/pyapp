Getting Started
###############

The recommended way to get started is to use the pyApp
`Cookie-Cutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html>`_
template. This will generate a working starting point to build your application
from.

Install cookie cutter::

    pip install cookiecutter


Finally create your project::

    cookiecutter gh:pyapp-org/pyapp.cookiecutter
