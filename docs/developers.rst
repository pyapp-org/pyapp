Developers
==========

The pyApp project (and sub projects) are open to accept pull requests.

There are however some requirements for any pull requests that must be met:

* Install the `pre-commit <https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit>`_ hooks to
  ensure you code is processed by `black <https://github.com/ambv/black>`_.

* Use `black <https://github.com/ambv/black>`_ on all code (including tests).

* Unit tests are required (we use pytest). Please ensure you only write *unit 
  tests* and these tests must be fast!

* Update the docs with the details (if required).

* The API matters, ensure any features provide a nice API for end users.
