Many features inspired by Django, but modified to be more general for use outside of web applications.

PyApp wit the release of 4.0 supports Python 3.6+ all previous versions are no longer supported.
This change allows for the user of F-Strings, and removal of any compatibility code.

So what do we handle?
=====================

- Configuration - Loading, merging your settings from different sources
  + Python modules
  + Files and HTTP(s) endpoints for JSON and YAML files.
- Instance Factories - Configuration of plugins, database connections, or just implementations of an ``ABC``.
  Leveraging settings to make setup of your application easy and reduce coupling.
- Checks - A framework for checking your settings are correct, can the application connect to that API end point?
- Application - Provides a extensible and simple CLI interface for adding more commands, comes with commands to support Checks, settings.

Coming soon

Support for common services eg email, as well as companion libraries to add plugin factories for SQL Alchemy, Redis, Paramiko, LDAP etc.
